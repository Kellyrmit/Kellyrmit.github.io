    <h1>Project Analysis of "Alien Translator"</h1>
    <h4>By Kelly Xiao (s4002452)</h4>

    <h3>Project beginning</h3>
    <p>
      The initial goal of Alien Translator was to create a generative sound tool
      where a unique sound would play each time the user typed. I wanted users
      to experience a pleasant and immersive soundscape through simple
      interaction. As the project evolved, I realised users might feel unsure
      about what to type, so I introduced prompts to guide them. This shifted
      the concept toward a conversation with a fictional character—an idea
      inspired by visual novel games. Key features I aimed to include were sound
      feedback when typing, volume control, an instruction pop-up for guidance,
      and branching narrative choices with different endings if there was extra
      time.
    </p>
    <h3>Project values</h3>
    <p>
      Besides the novelty of interactive sound feedback, I placed importance on
      user experience and aesthetic. I recognised the importance of giving users
      control over the volume and ensuring they were not confused about how to
      interact with the piece. This led to the addition of a volume button and
      initial plans for an instruction pop-up. Aesthetics were also a key value,
      especially given the alien sci-fi context of the project. To enhance
      immersion, I added floating animations to the character and a typing text
      animation, improving the overall user experience visually.
    </p>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      There were both conceptual and technical limitations that shaped the final
      form of the project. Due to time constraints, I chose to drop the
      narrative branching and instruction pop-up, but I did attempt to implement
      the latter. Technical challenges arose when the pop-up conflicted with the
      background layers, it would sometimes appear behind the character or leave
      the black overlay stuck onscreen. With limited time to debug, I ultimately
      decided to leave it out to maintain the functionality and polish other
      important elements. As an alternative, I utilised the alien's speech to
      give users info on what the confirm button does in case users felt lost.
    </p>
    <h3>Aesthetic choices</h3>
    <p>
      For the project's alien sci-fi aesthetic, it was a spontaneous idea. I
      thought it would be fun to draw an alien, so i ran with it. The visual
      style was influenced by a Pinterest board filled with pixel art, colours
      like blue and purple, and old-school game interfaces. I chose a pixel-like
      font and designed simple textboxes with light purple borders to match the
      aesthetic. I also experimented with button shapes, eventually settling on
      a rounded square design that visually aligned with the textbox style to
      create a consistent and cohesive look overall.
    </p>
    <h3>Creating cohesiveness in the project</h3>
    <p>
      To create a cohesive experience across the project, I carefully considered
      how the visual and sound elements would work together. For the audio, I
      chose a low, 8-bit sound to complement both the pixel art aesthetic and
      the alien-themed context of the project. Visually, the layout was kept
      simple and easy to navigate, with minimal interactive elements to avoid
      overwhelming the user. A consistent colour palette, like the recurring
      light purple was applied across textboxes, buttons, and text to maintain a
      unified and polished look throughout the interface.
    </p>
    <h3>Navigating the project</h3>
    <p>
      When developing the project, I first prioritised the overall structure of
      the code so I could build and integrate each element effectively. After
      setting up the foundation, I focused on creating the image assets, which
      were time-consuming but crucial for the visual context of the piece.
      Although I initially wanted to focus on sound design, the visual
      components took priority due to its importance in showing the project’s
      atmosphere and tone.
