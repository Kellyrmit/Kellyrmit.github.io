    <h1>Researching Wiggly Paint</h1>
    <h4>By Kelly Xiao</h4>

    <h2>Research Questions</h2>
    <h3>Q1.</h3>
    <p>
      WigglyPaint by Internet Janitor is a creative digital painter software
      that is experimental and abstract.
    </p>
    <h3>Q2.</h3>
    <p>
      Three other softwares in the digital painting genre include Krita, Adobe
      photoshop and MS Paint.
    </p>
    <h3>Q3.</h3>
    <p>
      WigglyPaint has many interactive features/mechanics, but the main ones I
      have interacted with includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wiggly Brushes: There are multiple fun textured brushes and highlighter
        that create wiggly animations when painted with.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sound effects: Each brush when utilised prodice a quirky wobbly sound
        that match the brushstrokes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Erasing and undo: The "OBLITERATE!" feature at the right bottom corner
        allows the user to explode the canvas, erasing everything while the
        "OOPS!" button undo the previous action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beyond the canvas: The software gives users the option to creatively
        paint and move around widgets outside the canvas by clicking tool in the
        menu bar.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Q4.</h3>
    <p>
      Brush sizes, multiple brush and shape options, colour manipulation,
      selection/lasso tool, crop, undo and obliteration of the canvas are all
      features/mechanics of WigglyPaint that match digital painting software
      conventions as they are commonly included and used in them. Therefore,
      indicating its genre to be a digital painter.
    </p>
    <h3>Q5.</h3>
    <p>
      The novel features/mechanics that set WigglyPaint apart from traditional
      digital painting software include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The wiggly brushstrokes: WigglyPaint as the name states, creates fluid
        strokes that constantly wiggles as the user paints unlike traditional
        digital painting tools.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sound effects: Brushes with its own sound effects that play when painted
        with gives a more fun immersive experience different from the typical
        paint softwares.
      </li>
      <li>
        Widget interactions: Users are unrestricted from just painting, they can
        also move the brushes and canvas around, which creates a playful and
        experimental envirionment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Q6.</h3>
    <p>
      Layering systems are a common feature in digital painting softwares that
      is missing in WigglyPaint. While adding a new canvas is possible, there
      isn't a display for seeing mulitple layers. Another feature that can be
      added is canvas rotation and zoom, so users can focus on an area better
      while painting.
    </p>
    <h3>Q7.</h3>
    <p>
      WigglyPaint is primary aimed at artists and creative enthusiasts who enjoy
      fun casual painting and want to explore with experimentally abstract
      digital paint softwares. It has a playful and simplistic design, and the
      wiggly brush mechanic encourages creative exploration without the
      pressured feeling of producing professional polished work in a more
      complex digital painting program.
    </p>
    <h3>Q8.</h3>
    <p>
      What i found annoying when interacting with WigglyPaint included how the
      marker size feature doesn't work when adjusting the brush sizes, as well
      as being lost on a blank white screen after clicking new deck or new card,
      not knowing how to get back.
    </p>
    <h3>Q9.</h3>
    <p>
      The most enjoyable interaction with WigglyPaint was the main wiggly
      feature with the sound effects. Creating an illustration with it being
      animated wiggly is fun and different from the typical digital paint
      softwares that i use.
