        1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The first thing I paid attention to was the visual design of the
        website. The monochromatic aesthetic paired with the minimalistic layout
        made it look easy to navigate and explore. I paid a lot of attention to
        the interactive calendar boxes on the left, as the concept was
        interesting and interacting with the Christmas objects hidden behind
        them was fun to play with.

        3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
        with?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The part of the experience I spent the most time engaging with was the
        interactive boxes on the left. Reading paragraphs of MyoungAe Kim’s
        portfolio work was interesting, but not as fun as clicking the boxes and
        interacting with the Christmas objects hidden inside. Through engaging
        with the interactive calendar boxes, I also discovered the website
        background colour could be changed to red by clicking on, “Merry
        Christmas” hidden in the 5th box.

        4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with
        the experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        My most common action in my two-minute interaction with the website was
        interacting with the calendar boxes. I clicked a lot on those boxes for
        a solid minute and dragged the hidden Christmas objects around with my
        mouse. I also spent some time clicking through the navigation links to
        the pages of her project works, scrolling up and down the images quickly
        to get an overview of her portfolio.

        5. What is the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        MyoungAe Kim’s primary goal for this interactive experience was to not
        only celebrate the year-end Christmas but also to showcase her portfolio
        work and style. She achieves this by designing this website with an
        advent calendar theme and a simple monochrome layout to highlight her
        minimalistic style.

    <div class="box">
      <h3>
        6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The main goal of the website was to celebrate the year-end, while also
        showcasing MyoungAe Kim’s portfolio. The website shows elements of fun
        surprises through hidden interactive Christmas objects and a background
        change within opening the calendar boxes. She effectively showcases her
        portfolio work through simple navigation, clear project images, bolded
        titles, and nicely spaced text, while keeping a minimalistic style that
        matches her work.

        7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
        with over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h3>
      <p>
        My impression of this website is that it’s designed for casual visitors,
        students, employers, etc. For casual visitors and students looking at
        the web portfolio for educational purposes, I think their experience
        would be more about exploring and taking their time interacting with the
        website and calendar boxes, which could last moderately 10-30 mins. For
        employers, they may take multiple visits with short minute durations to
        quickly peek at some of the work the designer has done for reference.

        8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with
        over time through the simple layout and clear visual cues that guides
        user interaction and easy navigation. For example, the titles of her
        portfolio works are bolded and underlined, indicating to the user that
        it can be clicked on for further information. Additionally, the
        Christmas objects shake when the user hovers the mouse on it, which is
        another visual cue that users can interact with it and move it around.
        Overtime, these design patterns and simple layout helps users
        intuitively understand how to interact with the website.

        9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This website experience references other media forms, such as an advent
        calendar. Advent calendars feature small, numbered flaps, each of which
        is opened daily during Advent to reveal a seasonally themed image. The
        numbered boxes in the website is similar to this, as some of the boxes
        have hidden Christmas themed objects that are interactable. Furthermore,
        the website’s minimalistic monochrome layout paired with small black
        circles in the corner of the portfolio work pages also reminds me of a
        notebook.

        10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
        act when engaging with your research experience?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The interactive boxes on the website, reminiscent of an Advent calendar,
        guide user behaviour by encouraging curiosity and exploration. Just how
        an Advent calendar invites users to uncover a new surprise each day,
        these interactive elements invite me to explore by clicking on the boxes
        to open them.

        11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should

      <p>
        The references in this website communicate that I should feel a mix of
        professionalism and festive joy when interacting with the research
        experience. The simple monochromatic design and portfolio images carry a
        modern and professional feel, while the interactive boxes bring elements
        of surprise and enjoyment as I explore the hidden festive objects.

        12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In my experience of interacting with this website, there are a few
        frustrating parts. If I had to nitpick, the tiny numbers under the
        images that allow the user to navigate through more images are too small
        to be noticeable and it is annoying to click on each number for each
        image. Another frustrating part is when I’m looking at the description,
        but some of it is cut off because my screen is not full screen (on mac)
        and there is no scroll feature. To see the whole description, I need to
        make my window full screen, which is kind of frustrating. Additionally,
        the red background change not staying red when navigating to another
        page disappointed me.

        13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The most satisfying part of the interaction for me was the interactive
        calendar boxes. It was satisfying opening them for the first time and
        seeing Christmas-themed objects hidden inside. I also found the hidden
        background colour change link and found it fun to switch the colour to
        red and white back and forth.
